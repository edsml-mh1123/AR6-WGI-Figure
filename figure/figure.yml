description: >
  This figure shows the annual-mean surface (2 m) air temperature (°C) for the
  period 1995–2014. It includes multiple panels:
  (a) Multi-model (ensemble) mean constructed with one realization of the CMIP6 historical experiment from each model.
  (b) Multi-model mean bias, defined as the difference between the CMIP6 multi-model mean
  and the climatology of the Fifth generation of ECMWF atmospheric reanalyses of the global climate (ERA5).
  (c) Multi-model mean of the root mean square error calculated over all months separately and averaged with respect to the
  climatology from ERA5.
  (d) Multi-model-mean bias as the difference between the CMIP6 multi-model mean and the climatology from ERA5.
  (e) Multi-model mean bias as the difference between the multi-model mean of high resolution simulations of four HighResMIP models and the climatology from ERA5.
  (f) Multi-model mean bias as the difference between the multi-model mean of low resolution simulations of four HighResMIP models and the climatology from ERA5.

  This figure is composed of multiple panels (a-f) as described in the description.
  Each panel represents different aspects of the surface temperature model analysis.
